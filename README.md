<h3>Investigation of zone plates illuminated with a Gaussian Bandwidth</h3>

Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) are widely used in X-ray microscopy (XRM) for their high spatial resolution and compatibility with full-field imaging, but their strong chromaticity poses challenges under broadband illumination such as that from laser-produced plasma sources. A common monochromaticity criterion, $\frac{N_z}{\zeta} \leq 1$, where $N_z$ is the number of zones and $\zeta$ the source monochromaticity, is often cited as a limit for negligible chromatic aberration, yet its quantitative implications for both resolution and depth of focus (DOF) remain poorly defined. Here, we introduce the zoneâ€“bandwidth ratio $Y = \frac{N_z}{\zeta}$ as a compact, design-relevant parameter that isolates the effect of the zone plate from other system complexities. Using Fresnel wave propagation simulations with radial Hankel transforms, we quantify resolution and DOF as functions of Y for Gaussian spectral profiles.
